# Barbarian

Rage
- Activated as a bonus action. 
- Lasts for one minute.
- Ends if you are knocked unconscious, take damage, or go a turn without attacking an enemy.
- Rages: 3
- Rage Damage: +2
- Advantage on strength checks and throws.
- Resistant to piercing, slashing, bludgeoning.

Unarmored Defense
- Without armor, armor class equals 10 plus your constitution modifier. Shields do not constitute armor.

Reckless Attack
- Throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. On the first attack of your turn, decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.

Danger Sense
- An uncanny sense of when things nearby aren’t as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger. You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you can’t be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated.

Legendary Protectors
- Spectral apparitions of familiar warriors and beasts appear when you enter your rage. While you're raging, the first creature you hit with an attack on your turn becomes the target of the spirits, which hinder its attacks. Until the start of your next turn, that target has disadvantage on any attack roll that isn't against you, and when the target hits a creature other than you with an attack, that creature has resistance to the damage dealt by the attack. The effect on the target ends early if your rage ends.

Extra Attack
- You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

Fast Movement
- Your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren’t wearing heavy armor.
